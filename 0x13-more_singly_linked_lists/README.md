# 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists

A linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence. The 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists repository extends the functionalities of the basic singly linked list (provided in a separate repository) and implements more operations, allowing for versatile manipulation of linked lists.
